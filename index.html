        <h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ravisorg/Mellt">Mellt</a> tests the strength of a password by calculating how long it would take to brute force it. Unlike most password strength checkers that just require one of each lowercase/uppercase/number/special char/at least 6 characters/etc, Mellt approaches the problem the same way a password cracker would, and returns a meaningful number you can use in determining the strength of a password. </p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Much of the logic / concept behind Mellt is based on the description of the <a href="http://www.hammerofgod.com/passwordcheck.aspx">TGP Password Strength Checker</a> by Timothy "Thor" Mullen.</p>

<p>The included common-passwords.txt contains the 10,000 most common passwords from <a href="http://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/">Mark Burnett's excellent password collection</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>PHP</h3>

<pre><code>include('Mellt.class.php');
$mellt = new Mellt();
$daysToCrack = $mellt-&gt;CheckPassword('my password');
</code></pre>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="Mellt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Make sure common-passwords.js is included AFTER Mellt.js --&gt;
&lt;script src="common-passwords.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var mellt = new Mellt();
var daysToCrack = mellt.CheckPassword('my password');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
