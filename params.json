Unlike most password strength checkers that just require one of each lowercase/uppercase/number/special char/at least 6 characters/etc, Mellt approaches the problem the same way a password cracker would, and returns a meaningful number you can use in determining the strength of a password. \r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\nMuch of the logic / concept behind Mellt is based on the description of the [TGP Password Strength Checker](http://www.hammerofgod.com/passwordcheck.aspx) by Timothy \"Thor\" Mullen.\r\n\r\nThe included common-passwords.txt contains the 10,000 most common passwords from [Mark Burnett's excellent password collection](http://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/).\r\n\r\nThe PHP and Javascript implementations were developed by [ravisorg](https://github.com/ravisorg).\r\n\r\nThe Node.js implementation was developed by [SeanJA](https://github.com/SeanJA).\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\n###PHP\r\n\r\n\tinclude('Mellt.class.php');\r\n\t$mellt = new Mellt();\r\n\t$daysToCrack = $mellt->CheckPassword('my password');\r\n\t\r\n###Javascript\r\n\t\r\n\t<script src=\"Mellt.js\"></script>\r\n\t<!-- Make sure common-passwords.js is included AFTER Mellt.js -->\r\n\t<script src=\"common-passwords.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script>\r\n\tvar mellt = new Mellt();\r\n\tvar daysToCrack = mellt.CheckPassword('my password');\r\n\t</script>\r\n\r\n###nodejs\r\n\r\n\tvar mellt = require(\"./lib/Mellt\");\r\n\tvar daysToCrack = mellt.CheckPassword('my password');\r\n\r\n##Security Q&A\r\n\r\n####Q: Those wacky crackers can see Mellt's code! They'll just use that to simplify their brute force attacks (eg: reversing the character sets)!\r\n\r\nA: The benefit to the attacker of seeing the source to Mellt is negligible. No user is going to think to them self \"I can save one character if I use z's instead of a's\". Their favorite password will be banned because it's too weak and they'll pick something stronger (vs just adding a $ to the end) - that's the purpose of these scripts.\r\n\r\n####Q: You include the top 10,000 common passwords, won't people (and crackers) just use the 10,001st most common?\r\n\r\nA: No, people don't work that way - they don't move down the list trying each one in turn. The purpose of banning the most common passwords is to prevent people from being lazy and using \"password\". Once you prevent that, you force them to be a little more creative and come up with something better.\r\n\r\n####Q: \"[pass123$](http://pastebin.com/b79cJV5f)\" isn't on the common list, but it's a terrible password! You should ban it!\r\n\r\nA: No, if it's not on the list of 10,000 most common, it's probably not that common. And the attacker doesn't know that it's a bad password when s/he starts trying to break it, so they need to try all the combinations to get there. \"pass123$\" is not a good password, but it's not \"[12345](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K95SXe3pZoY)\" bad. It's up to you as the developer implementing Mellt to decide the level of security you want to enforce. \"pass123$\" takes about 2 days via brute force, so set your limit to be higher than that if you don't want it allowed.\r\n\r\n####Q: Why do I need this tool? I'm hashing my passwords / preventing multiple attempts per second / etc...\r\n\r\nA: Mellt is assuming the attacker has your database of passwords. Of course you need to be hashing them (please tell me you're [not using MD5](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/)) but even with a properly salted+hashed password table it can be brute forced pretty quickly if the passwords are weak. Mellt is just another piece of the pie in making the attacker's life more difficult.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMellt is licensed under the Modified BSD License (aka the 3 Clause BSD).
