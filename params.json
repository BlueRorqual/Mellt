Unlike most password strength checkers that just require one of each lowercase/uppercase/number/special char/at least 6 characters/etc, Mellt approaches the problem the same way a password cracker would, and returns a meaningful number you can use in determining the strength of a password. \r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\nMuch of the logic / concept behind Mellt is based on the description of the [TGP Password Strength Checker](http://www.hammerofgod.com/passwordcheck.aspx) by Timothy \"Thor\" Mullen.\r\n\r\nThe included common-passwords.txt contains the 10,000 most common passwords from [Mark Burnett's excellent password collection](http://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/).\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\n\tinclude('Mellt.class.php');\r\n\t$mellt = new Mellt();\r\n\t$daysToCrack = $mellt->CheckPassword('my password');","google":"","name":"Mellt"}
